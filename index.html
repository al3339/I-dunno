  <h1>Topic!</h1>
  <p>We are going to be coding about the ACCU. The ACCU is a wonderful place to be and to go to school. The classes are small and the teachers are nice. The food is ok.the hallways are clean.</p>
<p>Next i'll be talking about the dress code. The dress code is unfair. It confines us to wearing the same type of clothes everyday. We can wear white, blue, yellow, and red shirts to school. we can wear navy blue or khaki pants. We don't have a big varity to choose from.  <p>
