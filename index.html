  <h1>Topic!</h1>
  <p>We are going to be coding about the ACCU. The ACCU is a wonderful place to be and to go to school. The classes are small and the teachers are nice. The food is ok.the hallways are clean.</p>
<p>Next I'll be talking about the dress code. The dress code is unfair. It confines us to wearing the same type of clothes everyday. We can wear white, blue, yellow, and red shirts to school. We can wear navy blue or khaki pants. We don't have a big varitey to choose from.  <p>
  <p>Next I'm going to be talking about the classroom setting. The classroom setting is different in every room because every teacher is different. Every teacher is different so how the room is set up will be different. Some teachers use chrome books and others don't use chrome books. I would use the chrome book for every class if I could.<p>
 <p>The final thing i'm going to be talking about is how all of the kids seem to like going to school here. I think that a lot of the kids love going to school here. I love going here. I like it because the classes are smaller and the teachers care about your sucess. It may be a lot of work, but you are earning college credits. That makes everything worth it for me.<p>
